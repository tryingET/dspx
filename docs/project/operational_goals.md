# Operational Goals

Active tactical goal: `TG25`

Authoritative live execution: Agent Kernel tasks for repo `/home/tryinget/ai-society/softwareco/owned/dspx`

## Active operating slices

1. **No repo-scoped implementation slice is pinned right now**
   - the repo-scoped ready queue is empty again and the closed `TG25` hardening baseline remains shut
   - keep the completed hardening scope closed instead of reopening it as a generic cleanup queue
   - status: closed / validation-clean baseline restored
2. **Next promotion/materialization step — no AK task yet**
   - with the hardening wave closed, the next truthful repo move is to promote/materialize `TG26` and freeze the explicit human-governed promotion-eligibility contract
   - do not guess or pre-write that contract as if it were already selected; first let AK truth name the next bounded slice
   - status: pending explicit materialization/promotion

## Recently completed in this wave

- `AK-835` — closed the remaining atomic hardening cleanup across config-managed env refresh, config TOML secret rejection, provider/runtime health+result sanitization, policy bypass audit logging, provider/tool registry locking, Pi RPC retry boundaries, refine TTY gating, receipt env-hash redaction, bounded data previews, generated-code worker fail-closed handling, and task-scope claim fallback; exported `governance/task-scopes/AK-835.snapshot.json`, re-exported the checked-in AK projection, and restored the full validation baseline.
- `AK-834` — landed the adversarial NEXUS hardening slice across Forge sanitize/workorder handling, the shared `dspx.security.confine_path()` primitive, replay path resolution, `parallel_first` success/readiness semantics, auth-provider structured error signaling, and Oracle frontier/territory correctness; exported `governance/task-scopes/AK-834.snapshot.json`, refreshed the checked-in AK projection, and added targeted regressions.
- `AK-800` — added request body size limits middleware to the DSPx server that rejects requests whose `Content-Length` exceeds a configurable limit (default 10 MiB) before the body is read, with human-friendly size parsing (`DSPX_MAX_BODY_SIZE`), enabled-by-default fail-closed semantics, extended the stats counter with `status_413`, and added 21 new regression tests.
- `AK-799` — flipped server auth to required-by-default, added `DSPX_AUTH_SKIP_FOR_DEV` as the explicit local-only bypass, refreshed server docs, and tightened server-side regressions so unauthenticated startup no longer happens by accident.
- `AK-798` — replaced contract-expression `eval()` with a tiny AST interpreter over a narrowed helper namespace plus a read-only embedding view, rejected arbitrary method calls / non-allowlisted helpers / arbitrary attribute traversal, and refreshed regressions.
- `AK-797` — confined `optimize_service._import_program_module()` to trusted program roots (`cwd`, the system temp root, plus `DSPX_TRUSTED_PROGRAM_ROOTS` overrides), added rejection/allowlist regressions, and refreshed the checked-in AK projection after completion.

## Notes

- `TG25` no longer has a repo-scoped ready slice in AK after `AK-835`.
- Keep the `AK-835` config/runtime/policy/registry/refine/receipt/task-scope hardening boundaries closed unless a smaller follow-up explicitly proves a regression.
- Keep the `AK-834` sanitize/workorder, shared path-confinement, replay-path, provider-racing, auth-provider, and frontier/territory correctness boundaries closed unless a smaller follow-up explicitly proves a regression.
- Keep the `AK-800` request body size limit boundary closed unless a smaller follow-up explicitly widens it.
- Keep the `AK-799` required-by-default server auth boundary closed unless a smaller follow-up explicitly widens it.
- Keep the `AK-797` trusted-program-root boundary closed unless a smaller follow-up explicitly widens it.
- Keep the `AK-798` narrowed contract-expression boundary closed unless a smaller follow-up explicitly widens the helper/attribute contract.
- Do not start live predictive ranking, candidate pruning, promotion blocking, or strategy/policy mutation while `TG25` remains the active tactical frontier; promote/materialize `TG26` explicitly instead of treating the closed hardening wave as implied authority.
- Older deferred/provider/runtime follow-ons (`AK-224`, `AK-235`–`AK-239`) remain non-active backlog and were intentionally not resumed in this wave.
- After AK task mutations for this wave, refresh the checked-in projection with `ak work-items export --repo /home/tryinget/ai-society/softwareco/owned/dspx --path governance/work-items.json` and verify with `ak work-items check --repo /home/tryinget/ai-society/softwareco/owned/dspx`.
- Task-scope validation is now snapshot-backed for both `AK-834` and `AK-835`; keep isolating each slice so working-tree validation stays truthful.
